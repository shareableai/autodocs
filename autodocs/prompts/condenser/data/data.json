The function takes in training data (X and y) and an optional array of sample weights. The model can be fit using either sparse or dense data and the function handles input validation to ensure compatibility between input shapes. The specific kernel used can be set as an argument to the function, with RBF being the default. The function also allows for setting a random seed for reproducibility.",

The output is a dictionary with parameter names mapped to their values. The argument 'deep' is set to True by default, which means it will also return the parameters for any sub-estimators."
