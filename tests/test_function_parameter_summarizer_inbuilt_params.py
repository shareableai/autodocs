C-Support Vector Classification.

    The implementation is based on libsvm. The fit time scales at least
    quadratically with the number of samples and may be impractical
    beyond tens of thousands of samples. For large datasets
    consider using :class:`~sklearn.svm.LinearSVC` or
    :class:`~sklearn.linear_model.SGDClassifier` instead, possibly after a
    :class:`~sklearn.kernel_approximation.Nystroem` transformer or
    other :ref:`kernel_approximation`.

    The multiclass support is handled according to a one-vs-one scheme.

    For details on the precise mathematical formulation of the provided
    kernel functions and how `gamma`, `coef0` and `degree` affect each
    other, see the corresponding section in the narrative documentation:
    :ref:`svm_kernels`.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <svm_classification>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    C : float, default=1.0
        Regularization parameter. The strength of the regularization is
        inversely proportional to C. Must be strictly positive. The penalty
        is a squared l2 penalty.

    kernel : {'linear', 'poly', 'rbf', 'sigmoid', 'precomputed'} or callable,          default='rbf'
        Specifies the kernel type to be used in the algorithm.
        If none is given, 'rbf' will be used. If a callable is given it is
        used to pre-compute the kernel matrix from data matrices; that matrix
        should be an array of shape ``(n_samples, n_samples)``.

    degree : int, default=3
        Degree of the polynomial kernel function ('poly').
        Must be non-negative. Ignored by all other kernels.

    gamma : {'scale', 'auto'} or float, default='scale'
        Kernel coefficient for 'rbf', 'poly' and 'sigmoid'.

        - if ``gamma='scale'`` (default) is passed then it uses
          1 / (n_features * X.var()) as value of gamma,
        - if 'auto', uses 1 / n_features
        - if float, must be non-negative.

        .. versionchanged:: 0.22
           The default value of ``gamma`` changed from 'auto' to 'scale'.

    coef0 : float, default=0.0
        Independent term in kernel function.
        It is only significant in 'poly' and 'sigmoid'.

    shrinking : bool, default=True
        Whether to use the shrinking heuristic.
        See the :ref:`User Guide <shrinking_svm>`.

    probability : bool, default=False
        Whether to enable probability estimates. This must be enabled prior
        to calling `fit`, will slow down that method as it internally uses
        5-fold cross-validation, and `predict_proba` may be inconsistent with
        `predict`. Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <scores_probabilities>`.

    tol : float, default=1e-3
        Tolerance for stopping criterion.

    cache_size : float, default=200
        Specify the size of the kernel cache (in MB).

    class_weight : dict or 'balanced', default=None
        Set the parameter C of class i to class_weight[i]*C for
        SVC. If not given, all classes are supposed to have
        weight one.
        The \"balanced\" mode uses the values of y to automatically adjust
        weights inversely proportional to class frequencies in the input data
        as ``n_samples / (n_classes * np.bincount(y))``.

    verbose : bool, default=False
        Enable verbose output. Note that this setting takes advantage of a
        per-process runtime setting in libsvm that, if enabled, may not work
        properly in a multithreaded context.

    max_iter : int, default=-1
        Hard limit on iterations within solver, or -1 for no limit.

    decision_function_shape : {'ovo', 'ovr'}, default='ovr'
        Whether to return a one-vs-rest ('ovr') decision function of shape
        (n_samples, n_classes) as all other classifiers, or the original
        one-vs-one ('ovo') decision function of libsvm which has shape
        (n_samples, n_classes * (n_classes - 1) / 2). However, note that
        internally, one-vs-one ('ovo') is always used as a multi-class strategy
        to train models; an ovr matrix is only constructed from the ovo matrix.
        The parameter is ignored for binary classification.

        .. versionchanged:: 0.19
            decision_function_shape is 'ovr' by default.

        .. versionadded:: 0.17
           *decision_function_shape='ovr'* is recommended.

        .. versionchanged:: 0.17
           Deprecated *decision_function_shape='ovo' and None*.

    break_ties : bool, default=False
        If true, ``decision_function_shape='ovr'``, and number of classes > 2,
        :term:`predict` will break ties according to the confidence values of
        :term:`decision_function`; otherwise the first class among the tied
        classes is returned. Please note that breaking ties comes at a
        relatively high computational cost compared to a simple predict.

        .. versionadded:: 0.22

    random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, default=None
        Controls the pseudo random number generation for shuffling the data for
        probability estimates. Ignored when `probability` is False.
        Pass an int for reproducible output across multiple function calls.
        See :term:`Glossary <random_state>`.

    Attributes
    ----------
    class_weight_ : ndarray of shape (n_classes,)
        Multipliers of parameter C for each class.
        Computed based on the ``class_weight`` parameter.

    classes_ : ndarray of shape (n_classes,)
        The classes labels.

    coef_ : ndarray of shape (n_classes * (n_classes - 1) / 2, n_features)
        Weights assigned to the features (coefficients in the primal
        problem). This is only available in the case of a linear kernel.

        `coef_` is a readonly property derived from `dual_coef_` and
        `support_vectors_`.

    dual_coef_ : ndarray of shape (n_classes -1, n_SV)
        Dual coefficients of the support vector in the decision
        function (see :ref:`sgd_mathematical_formulation`), multiplied by
        their targets.
        For multiclass, coefficient for all 1-vs-1 classifiers.
        The layout of the coefficients in the multiclass case is somewhat
        non-trivial. See the :ref:`multi-class section of the User Guide
        <svm_multi_class>` for details.

    fit_status_ : int
        0 if correctly fitted, 1 otherwise (will raise warning)

    intercept_ : ndarray of shape (n_classes * (n_classes - 1) / 2,)
        Constants in decision function.

    n_features_in_ : int
        Number of features seen during :term:`fit`.

        .. versionadded:: 0.24

    feature_names_in_ : ndarray of shape (`n_features_in_`,)
        Names of features seen during :term:`fit`. Defined only when `X`
        has feature names that are all strings.

        .. versionadded:: 1.0

    n_iter_ : ndarray of shape (n_classes * (n_classes - 1) // 2,)
        Number of iterations run by the optimization routine to fit the model.
        The shape of this attribute depends on the number of models optimized
        which in turn depends on the number of classes.

        .. versionadded:: 1.1

    support_ : ndarray of shape (n_SV)
        Indices of support vectors.

    support_vectors_ : ndarray of shape (n_SV, n_features)
        Support vectors.

    n_support_ : ndarray of shape (n_classes,), dtype=int32
        Number of support vectors for each class.

    probA_ : ndarray of shape (n_classes * (n_classes - 1) / 2)
    probB_ : ndarray of shape (n_classes * (n_classes - 1) / 2)
        If `probability=True`, it corresponds to the parameters learned in
        Platt scaling to produce probability estimates from decision values.
        If `probability=False`, it's an empty array. Platt scaling uses the
        logistic function
        ``1 / (1 + exp(decision_value * probA_ + probB_))``
        where ``probA_`` and ``probB_`` are learned from the dataset [2]_. For
        more information on the multiclass case and training procedure see
        section 8 of [1]_.

    shape_fit_ : tuple of int of shape (n_dimensions_of_X,)
        Array dimensions of training vector ``X``.
